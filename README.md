# aws-cloud9-nativefier
Wrapper script for natifier that wraps AWS Cloud9 :-)

# WTF wrapping a wrapper?

You unleash the powers of alt-tab for AWS Cloud9 by running:

  npm run build
  
 This will generate a nativefier app in ./dist which you can drag into your Applications folder (on Mac).
 
 ## DISCLAIMER
 
 I am not the author of nativefier. This is simply a personal hack.
